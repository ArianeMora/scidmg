## Differentially Methylated Genes
This package aims to consolidate DMRs (differentially methylated regions) and DMCs (differentially methylated cytosines)
and most importantly, develop a consistent, **unbiased** method for assigning a change in DNA methylation to a gene.

See [docs](https://arianemora.github.io/scidmg/) for more information.
